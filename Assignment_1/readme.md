Build a prototype for sms spam classification

In prepare.ipynb write the functions to 
* load the data from a given file path
* preprocess the data (if needed)
* split the data into train/validation/test 
* store the splits at train.csv/validation.csv/test.csv


In train.ipynb write the functions to
* fit a model on train data
* score a model on given data
* evaluate the model predictions
* validate the model
* fit on train
* score on train and validation
* evaluate on train and validation
* fine-tune hyper-params using train and validation (if necessary)
* score three benchmark models on test data and select the best one
