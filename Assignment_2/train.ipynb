    "Experiment tracking and model version control were successfully implemented using MLflow. Three benchmark models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree — were trained, evaluated, and tracked. The AUCPR metric was used to compare model performance, as it is well-suited for evaluating classification models, especially in scenarios with class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AUCPR scores for the models are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression AUCPR: 0.9755  \n",
    "- Random Forest AUCPR: 0.9892 \n",
    "- Decision Tree AUCPR: 0.7679 \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the three models, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest AUCPR score, indicating the best performance in distinguishing between the classes. Logistic Regression also performed well, showing strong baseline performance. However, the Decision Tree model had significantly lower AUCPR, suggesting lower generalization performance compared to the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All models were successfully tracked and registered using MLflow, ensuring reproducibility, experiment management, and proper model version control. Based on the evaluation results, the Random Forest model is selected as the best-performing model and is recommended for further use or deployment."
